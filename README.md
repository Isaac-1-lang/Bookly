GET /books?category=Programming&minRating=4&inStock=true&sort=rating&order=desc
```

Perfect for a "Best Programming Books" section on your website.

---

### Example 3: Paginated Search Results
```
GET /books?search=javascript&page=1&limit=10

## 📊 How Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination Work

### **Filtering**
- Client sends: `?category=Fiction&minPrice=10&maxPrice=20`
- Server builds MongoDB query: `{ category: 'Fiction', price: { $gte: 10, $lte: 20 } }`
- Only matching books are returned

### **Sorting**
- Client sends: `?sort=price&order=asc`
- Server adds to query: `.sort({ price: 1 })`
- Books are arranged from cheapest to most expensive

### **Pagination**
- Client sends: `?page=2&limit=10`
- Server calculates: `skip = (2 - 1) × 10 = 10`
- Server adds to query: `.skip(10).limit(10)`
- Returns books 11-20 (page 2)

### **All Together**
```javascript
Book.find({ category: 'Fiction', price: { $gte: 10, $lte: 20 } })
    .sort({ price: 1 })
    .skip(10)
    .limit(10)
```

This finds Fiction books between $10-$20, sorts by price ascending, and returns page 2 (books 11-20).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues
- Ensure MongoDB is running (`mongod` command)
- Check MongoDB Compass can connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017`
- Verify `.env` file has correct `MONGO_URI`

### Port Already in Use
- Change `PORT` in `.env` file
- Or stop the process using port 3000

### Seeding Fails
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check for validation errors in terminal
- Try running `npm run seed` again
